# Mars rover - Wallapop tech assignment

## Problem description

### Description

Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid.

- You will have to provide the map size
- You will have to provide the number of obstacles and their position
- You will have to provide the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
- The rover receives a character array of commands.
- Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
- Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
- Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
- Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.

### How to
We want to see your changes but not make them public. In order to do so create a new repo on bitbucket based on this project, make all the changes and give us access to see them ;).

We need the commit list in order to check the evolution, naming and changes you made during the process.

### What you expect
Our intern have made as good as it could but not as we would. 

- Feel free to change as much code as you want, but you'll have to make it readable and maintainable.
- Use any JVM language.
- Code should be self-executable and self-compiled. This includes any dependency manager we will need (hint: maven or gradle)
- Feel free to use any pattern, framework or whatever you want to.
- Bug free will be a plus.
- Include in your readme:
  A brief text explaining what tech stack you used, architecture, design patterns...
  Any problem you ran into while doing the code.
  What you think could be improved in case there is any improvement to your own code.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

As we are using gradle wrapper the project requires only a Java JDK or JRE version 8 or higher to be installed.
To check run `java -version`.

### Running the tests
 
```bash
./gradlew test
open build/reports/tests/test/index.html
```
Jococo has been added to check the overall coverage of the project, run:
```bash
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
open build/jacocoHtml/index.html
```
The Plugin seems to does not work pretty accurate with kotlin, some tested branches are not detected and
the *plugin gives you some false negatives*. 

### Building and packaging

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

### Running locally

Just run the fat-jar after building (previous section):
```bash
java -jar build/libs/mars-rover-kata-wp-all.jar --help
```
Working sample 
`java -jar build/libs/mars-rover-kata-wp-all.jar ffrfflfbf --initial-point="5 5" --direction=N --map-size="20 20"`
Or
```bash
 ./gradlew run --args='ffrfflfbf --initial-point="5 5" --direction=N --map-size="20 20"'
```

## Approach

In this exercise I have tried to do stick in two main things:
- Refactor the java legacy code that came with the enunciate.
- Use TDD to guide me through the design and cover all the code with tests.

The code is split in two main layers:

- cli: Command line interface framework, parsers and formatters
- core: Domain layer, all the logic

All fully tested, even the cli ðŸ¤˜

The code should be self explanatory and you will see that I have a lot of influence from functional programming, 
(immutability, lambdas, monads ...), but I have tried to make it as clean as possible.

Usually I keep and eye in the big picture, but in this kata I have been following YAGNI principle, so in theory the code
shouldn't be over-engineered.

If you check the commit log you will also see that I have been jumping from outside-in to inside-out TDD approaches 
during the exercise.

## Tech stack

- Language: Kotlin
- 3rd party libs:
    - Testing:
        - JUnit5
        - Mockito 2
        - Assertk
        - Jococo
    - Functional Programming support: Arrow
    - CLI: clikt
    
## Improvements

After only two days working in that exercise I have leaved it with some pending improvements:

- Grid validation, the size (negative values) and the obstacles (are they inside the grid?) are not validated
- Better integration testing of the cli
- Use `spek` instead `junit5` for testing
- Use `mockk` instead of `mockito`
- Logging
- Think about a model that supports infinite command parsing
- Find a better coverage library
- Add a usecase/service layer to decouple and orchestrate presentation from domain 
- CI
